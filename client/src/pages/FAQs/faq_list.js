        question: 'Why is it important to detect stomata?',
        panel: 'panel1',
        answer: "Detecting stomata can provide valuable insights into a plant's physiological processes, such as photosynthesis and transpiration.It can also help in studying plant responses to environmental factors and diseases.",

        question: 'How does the stomata detection process work?',
        panel: 'panel2',
        answer: 'The stomata detection process involves analyzing the microscopic view of a leaf, either in photo or video format, using advanced image processing techniques. These techniques identify and locate the stomata on the leaf surface.',

        question: 'Can stomata detection be performed on both photos and videos?',
        panel: 'panel3',
        answer: 'Yes, our stomata detection system is capable of analyzing both photos and videos of leaf samples to detect and quantify stomata.',

        question: 'What are the potential applications of stomata detection?',
        panel: 'panel4',
        answer: 'Stomata detection can be used in various fields such as plant physiology research, agriculture, environmental monitoring, and crop breeding programs to assess plant health, water-use efficiency, and response to different environmental conditions.',
